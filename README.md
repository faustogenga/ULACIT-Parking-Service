## Parking Reservation Website - HTML/JS/CSS/PHP/SQL

**Download and set up the database locally using our SQL files, and make the necessary changes to the connection in the connection.php file.**

## Currently Hosted in Netlify
Designed a Parking Reservation Website prototype for college using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL Server.
Hosted on Netlify for visualization, the project allows users to reserve parking spots, highlighting my proficiency in full-stack development and creating a practical and user-friendly solution.

Front-End hosted in Netlify with the reservation form connected to Netlify forms just as a visual test / prototype. 
Project provides all php and sql files in order to run with a local database, as intended.

This project was made for the Web Application Development class 16-5003, ULACIT. \
All resources are used for learning / school related purposes. \
